Project Synopsis-Group 5

Project Title:State Level Liquor Sales Analysis

Problem Statement:
Demand & Trend Analysis
Liquor sales vary across regions and time due to seasonal and consumption patterns, making it difficult to understand demand distribution and trends from raw sales data.

Performance Evaluation & Decision Support
Analyzing product and vendor performance is complex without consolidated insights, creating a need for an interactive analytical dashboard to support data-driven decisions.

Objectives:
1.	To analyze state-level liquor sales data in order to identify meaningful patterns and trends that support data-driven planning and decision-making for state authorities.
2.	To analyze regional variations in liquor sales by studying volume sold and sales value across different counties and cities.
3.	To identify time-based and seasonal trends in liquor sales using historical transaction data.
4.	To evaluate product and vendor performance based on sales volume and revenue contribution.
5.	To design and develop an interactive dashboard that presents key insights in a clear and user-friendly manner.
6.	To support future enhancements such as demand forecasting and trend prediction using analytical techniques.

Scope of the Project:
•	Analyze state-level liquor sales data
•	Study wholesale transactions between the state authority and licensed retailers
•	Identify region-wise (county/city) demand patterns
•	Analyze time-based trends such as monthly and yearly sales variations
•	Evaluate product-wise and vendor-wise performance
•	Present insights through an interactive dashboard

Data Description:
The dataset used in this project is the Iowa Liquor Sales dataset, published by the state of Iowa through its open data portal. It contains structured, transactional records of wholesale liquor sales made by the state authority to licensed retailers across Iowa.
The dataset includes information on sales dates, store locations, products, vendors, pricing, and volume sold, and represents sales at an aggregate level without individual customer details. Covering multiple years of historical data, it is suitable for analyzing regional demand patterns, seasonal trends, and product performance through exploratory data analysis and visualization.

Tool and Technologies Used:
•	AWS S3
•	Lambda
•	AWS Glue
•	AWS Athena
•	Power Bi / Tablue
•	Terraform
•	GitHub

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
•	Total Sales (Dollars)
•	Total Revenue Generated
•	Total Volume Sold
•	Average Profit Margin
•	Sales by City 
•	Volume sold by City
•	Monthly Sales Trend
•	Year Wise Sales Growth
•	Top Products by Volume

Expected Outcome:
•	A clear understanding of state-level liquor sales patterns through analysis of historical wholesale transaction data.
•	Identification of regional demand variations across counties and cities based on sales value and volume sold.
•	Discovery of time-based and seasonal trends that highlight peak sales periods and long-term sales behavior.
•	Insights into product categories and vendor performance, identifying fast-moving products and major contributors to revenue.
•	An interactive dashboard that visually presents key KPIs and analytical insights, enabling quick and informed decision-making.
•	A data-driven foundation that can support future enhancements such as demand forecasting and advanced analytics.

Conclusion:
This project successfully analyzes the Iowa Liquor Sales dataset to derive meaningful insights from state-level wholesale liquor sales data. By applying exploratory data analysis techniques, the project identifies regional demand patterns, seasonal sales trends, and product and vendor performance at an aggregate level.
The use of interactive dashboards enables clear and intuitive visualization of key metrics such as sales value, volume sold, and regional distribution, making the data easily interpretable for decision-makers. Although individual customer-level information is not included, the analysis provides valuable support for planning, distribution management, and data-driven policy decisions.
Overall, the project demonstrates how structured government data can be effectively transformed into actionable insights using data analytics and visualization techniques.
